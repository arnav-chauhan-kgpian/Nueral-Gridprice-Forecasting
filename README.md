# The Neural Grid: Deep Learning for Smart Electricity Pricing 
Project performed by- Arnav Chauhan, UG Student [IIT-Kharagpur'27]
In an era where energy markets fluctuate unpredictably, accurate electricity price forecasting is more crucial than ever. Driven by a dynamic interplay of supply, demand, weather conditions, electricity prices exhibit complex patterns that challenge traditional forecasting methods.  

This project harnesses the power of advanced machine learning and time-series modeling—including LSTMS,Encoder-Decoders,CNN-stacked LSTMs and other complex architectures—to predict electricity prices with greater precision. By integrating historical consumption trends, weather data, and market signals, I aim to develop a robust forecasting model capable of delivering reliable **day-ahead** price predictions, **greatly outperforming the original TSO(Transmission Supply Operator) similar forecast**

The data has been taken from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nicholasjhana/energy-consumption-generation-prices-and-weather under the https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/ (no copyright) public domain license
Description of data is as follows:
This dataset contains 4 years of electrical consumption, generation, pricing, and weather data for Spain. Consumption and generation data was retrieved from ENTSOE a public portal for Transmission Service Operator (TSO) data. Settlement prices were obtained from the Spanish TSO Red Electric España. Weather data was purchased as part of a personal project from the Open Weather API for the 5 largest cities in Spain and made public here.

This project encompasses all the components of a business-level forecasting methodology, be it data preprocessing and EDA, feature engineering, advanced time series analysis or meticulate application of state-of-the-art deep learning nueral architectures.
